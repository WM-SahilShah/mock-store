## Prerequisites

### Node.js 20+

We officially support the current LTS version â€“ 20 at the time of writing. YNS should work on versions 18, 20, and 22. If you're using one of those versions and encounter a problem, please report it!

#### Installing Node.js

Follow the instructions for your operating system found here: [nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

### pnpm 9+

We officially support pnpm version 9, but we will do our best to keep it compatible with npm and yarn.

#### Installing pnpm

The easiest way to install pnpm is via Node.js Corepack. Inside the folder with YNS, run these commands:

```bash
corepack enable
corepack install
```

Alternatively, follow the instructions for your operating system found here: [pnpm.io/installation](https://pnpm.io/installation)

4. After that, you can start the container with `pnpm run docker:run`.
